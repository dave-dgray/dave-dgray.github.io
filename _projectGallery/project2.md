    ‘Ghosts and Shadows’ was a collaborative installation project, commissioned by The Beetroot Tree Gallery in Derbyshire.
    My illustrations were inspired by wordsmith Dave Wood’s poetic response to the gallery’s history - they were realised as a set of sequential visuals and typographic snippets that told a story.
    The final installation of images placed in panes of suspended, reclaimed window frames was shown in the actual gallery space - accompanied by readings and atmospheric audio.
    Some images were selected for an Association of Illustrators ‘Images’ book and  exhibition.
    Art direction, styling and concept development projects for fashion and photography.
