    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
      We pride ourselves on our personal touch, pragmatic approach and attention to detail to suit your project needs.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
      We can advise on all building types and uses; residential, commercial, ecclesiastical, agricultural or industrial heritage and at all stages of your property’s life cycle.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
      While we are specialists in work to listed buildings, we also advise on older unlisted buildings, that either require an understanding of historic construction methods or an approach that is sensitive to their historic character.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
      We also provide building condition surveys and, specialising in historic property, means that we are best placed to advise you on the most appropriate repairs.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
      Where works require planning permission and/or listed building consent, we can provide advice and prepare and submit applications on your behalf.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
      So whether it’s an alteration or extension project or advice on a building’s condition, repair or conservation, contact us for an initial consultation meeting.
    </p>
