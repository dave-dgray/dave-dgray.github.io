      Building Surveys
    </h4>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    Historic buildings are full of character and can be lovely properties to live in. However, if you are
    considering buying an older or listed property, it is vital you fully understand what you are about to
    take on.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    I can undertake and provide you with a pre-purchase building survey (also known as a structural survey). This is a detailed assessment and report of the building’s condition and also outlines appropriate repairs, to enable you to make an informed decision about your potential purchase.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    This is particularly important where the property is statutorily listed, as potential repairs may require a specific approach or material, which can differ from more widely known modern construction practices and methods.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    Similarly, the listing of a building afects what can be altered, which means you could be inheriting
    responsibility for existing unapproved alterations or your own ideas for altering and/or extending the
    property once purchased may be restricted.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    I feel that it is really important for you to you fully understand the key elements of the building that you are considering buying. As such, my aim is to provide you with a report that gives a clear and concise assessment of the condition of the building and advise on any repairs.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    If having read the survey report, you are still unsure or are struggling to fully understand a particular
    element of construction or issue, I am happy to discuss it further with you.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    Unlike more modern buildings, older and listed properties can have unusual types of construction.
    As a Chartered Building Surveyor and specialist in historic buildings and building conservation, I can
    offer you the benefit of my knowledge and experience in surveying, repairing and altering
    older and historic buildings.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    While different types of survey are available, the RICS (Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) do not recommend anything less than a full building survey (structural survey) when purchasing properties that are large, older listed) or run-down, a building that is unusual or altered, or if you’re planning major works.
    </p>

    <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    So give me a call to discuss your potential property and I will be happy to
    provide you with a quotation.
