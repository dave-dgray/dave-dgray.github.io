    A Gaol Breathes Again
  </h4>
  <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    A publicly owned redundant gaol, dating from around the start of the 18th Century. The Parish Council appointed me to advise them on the replacement of the sand:cement render with a lime based render.  Working closely with the Local Authority Conservation Officer, I attained a Listed Building Consent approval for the works. Project reference code 108.
