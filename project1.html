    REPAIRS TO THE TOWER
  </p>
  <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    A Grade 1 listed church dating from the 14th Century.
  </p>
  <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    I was initially appointed by the Parochial Church Council to undertake an inspection and prepare a specification of works for stonemasonry repairs to the west tower.
  </p>
  <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    Following delays, due to funding streams, they then appointed me to oversee and advise them on the implementation of the works, as well as acting as Contract Administrator for the project, and providing advice in respect of the Construction Design and Management Regulations, which govern Health and Safety in construction projects.
  </p>
  <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    The scheme is currently still on site and due to complete shortly.

  <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    Project reference code 102.
