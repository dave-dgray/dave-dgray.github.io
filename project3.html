    A Stable Extension

  <p class="font-small text-left color-black">
    A private dwelling house.  While not listed itself, it once formed a stable block and outbuildings for an adjacent Grade 2 listed building and is also located in the Metropolitan Greenbelt. I am currently working on an extensive extension and alteration scheme to the property, which is awaiting planning permission.  This has involved the use of my 3D design software to help visualise the proposed scheme and new internal spaces for the client. Project reference code 115.
