title: A SIZEABLE SURVEY
permalink: /project7/
desc:
    A survey of a substantial 6 bedroom residential, Grade 2 listed, property with a large range of outbuildings to the rear.<br><br>
    While the main house was generally in a fair condition, the outbuilding had some significant structural defects.  The survey also required inspection of rarely accessed roof voids in order to provide a complete detailed survey report of the property.  As well as assisting in identifying potential defects and repairs, this level of inspection enables a better understanding of a property’s historic significance, which is necessary when looking to alter a listed building.<br><br>
    The client has already contacted me in respect of some alterations they require further advice on.<br><br>
    Project reference code 133.
