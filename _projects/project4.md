desc:
      A private dwelling dating back to the 16th Century.<br><br>
      Surviving wall paintings, linen fold paneling and a hexagonal stair tower are just some of the features that mean the property is listed Grade 2*.<br><br>
      Following preparation of a full measured survey, I was required to advise on several separate alterations requiring listed building consent, including the installation of a ground source heat pump, improvements in heating and ventilation to help combat a deathwatch beetle problem.<br><br>
      Project reference code 114.
