permalink: /project8/
desc:
    A private dwelling house, predominantly dating from the 18th Century, statutorily listed Grade 2, with historical links to the Bowes Lyons family.<br><br>
    While at ADP, I attained eight separate planning and/or Listed Building Consent approvals, required for various alterations and extensions; prepared additional drawn details to clear numerous pre-commencement planning conditions.  One of these approvals involved the removal of an unsightly and dilapidated 1970â€™s lean-to link and the formation of a new kitchen link extension at the rear of the property.<br><br>
    Following planning and Building Regulation Plans approval I also prepared and tendered the scheme.<br><br>
    Project reference code 101.<br><br>
